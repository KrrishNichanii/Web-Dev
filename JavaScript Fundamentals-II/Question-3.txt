Question 3: List and describe the five primitive data types in JavaScript.

Ans:
 1) Number:

The Number data type represents numeric values. It includes both integers and floating-point numbers (decimals).
Examples: 42, 3.14159, -10, 0.5

2) String:

The String data type represents text and is enclosed in single or double quotes.
Examples: "Hello, World", 'JavaScript', "123"

3) Boolean:

The Boolean data type has two values: true and false. It is used for representing logical values.
Examples: true, false

4) Undefined:

The Undefined data type has a single value, undefined, which represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
Example: let x; // x is undefined

5)Null:

The Null data type has a single value, null, which represents the intentional absence of any object value or a placeholder for an object that will be created later.
Example: let y = null;
