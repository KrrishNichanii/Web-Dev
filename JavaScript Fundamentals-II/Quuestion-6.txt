Question 6: Explain the importance of choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names in JavaScript.
Provide an example where using a clear identifier improves code readability.

Ans:

1) Maintaining Best Practices:

Using meaningful variable names is a best practice in software development. It aligns with industry standards and conventions, making your code more professional and maintainable

2) Collaboration:

In collaborative projects, meaningful variable names improve communication among team members. They ensure that everyone is on the same page and understands the purpose and usage of each variable.

3) Code Readability:

Meaningful variable names make your code more readable and self-explanatory. When someone else reads your code or when you revisit it after some time, descriptive names convey the purpose of the variable


Code example :


// Less Descriptive Variable
let x = 20; // What does 'x' represent in this context?

// More Descriptive Variable
let numberOfUsers = 20; // It's clear that 'numberOfUsers' represents a count.
