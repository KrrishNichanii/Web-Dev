// Question-1  Explain the usage of ternary operator with syntax and write a program to check whether the number is even
//             or odd using the ternary operator.

// The ternary operator, also known as the conditional operator, is a concise way to express a conditional (if-else) statement in JavaScript. It is often used as a shorthand for simple decision-making within an expression. 

let num=5;
(num%2==0)?console.log(`${num} is even`):console.log(`${num} is odd`)
