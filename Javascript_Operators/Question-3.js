//Question-3

// Use a nested ternary operator to check that a number is positive, negative or zero. You have to print
// “positive” if the number is positive and similarly for negative and zero also.

let num=-5;

(num==0)?console.log("Number is zero"):(num>0)?console.log(`${num} is positive`):console.log(`${num} is negative`)
