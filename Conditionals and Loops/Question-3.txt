What are loops, and what do we need them? Explain different types of loops with their syntax and
examples.

Ans :  
Loops in programming are used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition is true. They are essential for automating repetitive tasks, iterating over data structures, and streamlining the execution of code.


1) for loop 

for (initialization; condition; iteration) {
    // Code to be executed in each iteration
}

2) while loop

while (condition) {
    // Code to be executed as long as the condition is true
}

3)  do-while loop

do {
    // Code to be executed at least once
} while (condition);
