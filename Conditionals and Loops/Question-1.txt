Question-1

What are conditional statements? Explain conditional statements with syntax and examples.

Ans : Conditional statements in programming are used to make decisions based on certain conditions. They allow the execution of different code blocks depending on whether a specified condition evaluates to true or false. In JavaScript, there are primarily two types of conditional statements: if statements and switch statements.

1)  The if statement is used to execute a block of code if a specified condition is true. It can be extended with else and else if clauses to handle different scenarios.

if (condition) {
    // Code to be executed if the condition is true
} else if (anotherCondition) {
    // Code to be executed if anotherCondition is true
} else {
    // Code to be executed if none of the conditions are true
}


2)  The switch statement is used to evaluate an expression against multiple possible case values. It provides an alternative way to structure code when there are multiple conditions to be checked.

switch (expression) {
    case value1:
        // Code to be executed if expression matches value1
        break;
    case value2:
        // Code to be executed if expression matches value2
        break;
    // More cases can be added as needed
    default:
        // Code to be executed if none of the cases match
}
